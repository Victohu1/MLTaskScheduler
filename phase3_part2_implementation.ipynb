    "## Inputs\n",
    "1. A Google cluster data text file located in the same directory as the script and stored in .cvs format (hardcoded as “google-cluster-data-1.csv”).\n",
    "2. Constants for the setup (values for VMs are between phase 1 and phase 2 to have a small number of soft rejections).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "1. Command line prints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Round Robin Algorithm\n",
    "1. Data is imported from the csv file using Pandas.\n",
    "2. The values for Task ID, Task CPU, Task MEM, and Task Burst Time are extracted into Task objects.\n",
    "3. The RR algorithm is run for each time quantum from the start time to the end time. \n",
    "\t- The task queue is formatted with tasks in the following order: \n",
    "\t\t- tasks already on the task queue\n",
    "\t\t- new tasks at the current time\n",
    "\t\t- tasks that ran in the previous time.\n",
    "\t- The VMs are reset to full capacity at the begging of the iteration.\n",
    "\t- Tasks are taken off the task queue and placed in a VM.\n",
    "\t\t- The first VM is the starting point at the begging of the iterations.\n",
    "\t\t- Each subsequent iteration starts searching for a VM at VM i+1.\n",
    "\t\t- If a task cannot fit on the i+1 VM, then the remaining VMs are searched until VM j can fit the task.\n",
    "\t\t- If none of the VMs can fit the task, the task will be soft rejected and placed back into the task queue for the next iteration.\n",
    "\t- Once all tasks have run or been soft rejected, the algorithm returns the list of tasks along with the remaining capacity of the VMs.\n",
    "4. Tasks that were rejected after all iterations of the RR algorithm for all the given times are added to the rejection list.\n",
    "5. The energy and cost used by the VMs is calculated using the dictionary of VM usage at each time step. See comments in the code for a more in-depth explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Turn Around Time Algorithm\n",
    "1. Data is imported from the csv file using Pandas.\n",
    "2. The values for Task ID, Task CPU, Task MEM, and Task Burst Time are extracted into Task objects.\n",
    "3. The Greedy algorithm is run for each time quantum from the start time to the end time using the task queue for the current time.\n",
    "\t- The task queue is sorted to optimize for turnaround time.\n",
    "\t\t- The turnaround time for each task is equal to the sum of the waiting time and the required execution time.\n",
    "\t\t- Since the execution time is fixed, the waiting time must be minimized to optimize the turnaround time.\n",
    "\t\t- To minimize the total turnaround time of all the tasks, the total waiting must be minimized. Minimizing the waiting time is accomplished by always prioritizing the task with the shortest remaining burst time to run.\n",
    "\t\t- To do this, the task queue is sorted from the task with the smallest remaining burst time to the task with the largest remaining burst time.\n",
    "\t- Assign tasks to the VMs using the sorted next fit Greedy Algorithm to optimize (minimize) the turnaround time.\n",
    "\t\t- For each task, greedily assign the task to the next available VM after the previous task was placed.\n",
    "\t\t- If none of the VMs can fit the task, the task will be soft rejected and placed back into the task queue for the next iteration.\n",
    "\t- Once all tasks have run or been soft rejected, the algorithm returns the list of tasks along with the remaining capacity of the VMs.\n",
    "4. Tasks that were rejected after all iterations of the Greedy algorithm are added to the rejection list.\n",
    "5. The energy and cost used by the VMs is calculated using the dictionary of VM usage at each time step. See comments in the code for a more in-depth explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "#### Assumptions with the format \"Assumption #\" are repeated in code blocks that use the assumption.\n",
    "1. Assumption 1: A task is always run if there is room for it in any VM when it is being scheduled (cannot be chosen to wait).\n",
    "2. Assumption 2: For Round Robin, we search from first VM (same assumption as in lab 3/4).\n",
    "3. Assumption 3: For Round Robin, search from i+1 instead of j+1 (same assumption as in lab 3/4).\n",
    "4. Assumption 4: Each task requires its full resources for the duration of its burst time.\n",
    "5. Assumption 5: If a task on the task queue cannot fit in a VM, it will be soft rejected and retain its place in the task queue and any newly arrived tasks in the next iteration will be after it in the task queue.\n",
    "6. Assumption 6: assume that any tasks that are not finished by 9pm are hard rejected because the price model per hour stops at 9pm. Only hard rejections (all subtasks of the task were not able to be run) are saved into the rejection .npy file.\n",
    "7. Assumption 7: In the VMs_#_versionNumber.npy file, the object stored in the file is the values of the VM resources after running the scheduling algorithm for the very last time step (see Assumption 8 for a definition of the very last time step). The object stored in the file is a 2D array to store the CPU and the MEM remaining of each VM.\n",
    "8. Assumption 8: The \"very last time step\" is the last time step when new tasks are introduced (112500 for the given data set).\n",
    "9. Program was written and tested with Python 3.9.6 and run using a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "10. The included .npy files in the submission were generated by running the script. The .ipynb file also contains the outputs generated after running the script. When running the script, always \"Run All\" instead of individual blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "1. File was started from the file provided during discussion, “RR_lab3.ipynb,” and Joshua Williams's submission for lab 4.\n",
    "2. Code blocks that save the data into .npy files are inspired by the NumPy \"save\" documentation at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.save.html. The files outputted are binary files that can only be accessed by using \"numpy.load(<file>)\".\n",
    "3. The algorithm enum was based off of the Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html\n",
    "4. To sort the custom task object, I used the attrgetter import described at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4010322/sort-a-list-of-class-instances-python/4010558\n",
    "5. Greedy algorithms are loosely based off of the algorithms described at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bin-packing-problem-minimize-number-of-used-bins/\n",
    "6. The measurement of execution time uses the time() function that is detailed at https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/time"
